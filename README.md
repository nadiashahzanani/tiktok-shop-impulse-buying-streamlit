## SV of Students' Impulse Buying Behavior on TikTok Shop

## Group Problem Statement
TikTok Shop has become very popular among students because it combines entertainment, promotions, and instant purchasing in one platform. Many students end up buying products impulsively without planning or careful consideration. However, students are often not fully aware of what factors influence their impulse buying behavior, such as promotions, product presentation, trust, and social influence.

At the same time, sellers and marketers lack clear visual insights into how these factors affect students’ purchasing decisions. Without proper data analysis and visualization, it is difficult to understand patterns, trends, and relationships within impulse buying behavior. Therefore, there is a need to analyze and visualize survey data to better understand the determinants of students’ impulse buying behavior on TikTok Shop.

## Group Objectives
1. To identify the key factors that influence students’ impulse buying behavior on TikTok Shop.  
2. To analyze students’ impulse buying tendencies using survey data collected through an online questionnaire.  
3. To apply scientific visualization techniques to present impulse buying patterns clearly and effectively.  
4. To explore relationships between demographic factors (such as age, gender, and income) and impulse buying behavior.

## Project Overview
This project will presents an interactive Streamlit application developed to analyze students' impulse buying behavior on TikTok Shop. The application uses survey responses from university students and applies scientific visualization techniques to reveal patterns, trends, and correlations between various factors influencing impulse purchases.

## Features
- Interactive filters for demographic information (age, gender, income)
- Five different scientific visualizations showing the impact of key factors
- Clear interpretation of impulse buying behavior for better understanding
- Streamlit-based interactive dashboard for real-time data exploration

## Tools Used
- Python  
- Streamlit  
- Pandas  
- Plotly (for interactive visualizations)  
- Matplotlib  
- Seaborn  

## Dataset
Survey responses were collected from university students using Google Forms.

## Deployment
The application is deployed using [Streamlit Cloud](https://share.streamlit.io/) and provides an interactive interface for exploring the survey results and visualizations.
