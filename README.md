# Project Scientific Visualization

## Project Overview
This project explores **students' impulse buying behavior on TikTok Shop** using scientific visualization techniques. The goal is to identify key factors influencing impulse buying and present them interactively using Streamlit.

The main objectives is to analyze and visualize the factors influencing online impulse buying behavior by examining demographics, shopping experience, psychological drivers, trust and product presentation using scientific data visualization techniques.

## Dataset
The dataset consists of survey responses from students about their experience and behavior on TikTok Shop. It has been cleaned and preprocessed to calculate factor scores including overall impulse buying score.

## Each Focuses
- **Sub-Objective 1:** Analyze the **demographic profile** and **TikTok Shop usage.** Visualizations like bar chart, pie charts and treemaps. Th focusing to understanding the profile of respondents based on gender, age, faculty and monthly income.
- **Sub-Objective 2:** Evaluate the influence of **scarcity and unexpected product discovery** on shopping behavior. By using visualizations like radar charts, box plots or likert charts. To determining how limited-time offers and surprise product discovery influence impulse buying.
- **Sub-Objective 3:** Examine the role of **trust and shopping motivation** on TikTok Shop. Visualizations include bar charts, box plots, radar charts, scatter plots, and heatmaps showing relationships between trust and motivation factors.
- **Sub-Objective 4:** Analyze **product presentation, shopping lifestyle and impulse buying behavior** by using visualizatios like scatter plot, radar charts and correlation heatmaps. This focus to evaluating how visual product elements and shopping habits impact impulse buying.
